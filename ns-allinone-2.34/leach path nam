Please put /home/chiranjib/ns-allinone-2.34/bin:/home/chiranjib/ns-allinone-2.34/tcl8.4.18/unix:/home/chiranjib/ns-allinone-2.34/tk8.4.18/unix
into your PATH environment; so that you'll be able to run itm/tclsh/wish/xgraph.

IMPORTANT NOTICES:

(1) You MUST put /home/chiranjib/ns-allinone-2.34/otcl-1.13, /home/chiranjib/ns-allinone-2.34/lib, 
    into your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.
    If it complains about X libraries, add path to your X libraries 
    into LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
    If you are using csh, you can set it like:
		setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH <paths>
    If you are using sh, you can set it like:
		export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<paths>

(2) You MUST put /home/chiranjib/ns-allinone-2.34/tcl8.4.18/library into your TCL_LIBRARY environmental
    variable. Otherwise ns/nam will complain during startup.


After these steps, you can now run the ns validation suite with
cd ns-2.34; ./validate
